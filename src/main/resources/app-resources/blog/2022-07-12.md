## We have a nice Exception page!

One of the most important tools for fast development is good error reporting. Unsurprisingly, this becomes really, really important during the develompent of a framework.

So â€” ```ng-objects``` now sports it's very own exception page based on the look of Wonder's ERXExceptionPage (which I also wrote several years back, what a huge coincidence). Just look at it! Isn't it lovely?
