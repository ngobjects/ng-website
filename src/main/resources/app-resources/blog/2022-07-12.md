## We have a nice Exception page!

One of the most important tools a developer can have is good error reporting. And incidentally, it's also really useful during the development of a web framework.

```ng-objects``` now sports it's very own exception page based on the look of Wonder's ERXExceptionPage (which, so happens, I also wrote several years back. What a huge coincidence).
this work also helped figure out concepts in the environment, required the implementation of a new Dynamic Element (```NGGenericContainer```) and helped me figure out a couple of things in templating.

Dogfooding is useful.

And now what? Well, it feels exceptions should be handled in different ways depending on in what environment they happen. In development, you want that exception and the related code in your face as quickly as possible. In production, you want the user to be somewhat informed about what happened, perhaps with a nice look, a vague idea about what happened (if possible) and a method to report it, and from that report, you should be able to get at debugging information fast and easy to see what happened.

That's work for the next few months. But for now, we at least have an exception page in development. Just look at it! Isn't it lovely?
