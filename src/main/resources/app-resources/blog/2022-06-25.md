## Desperately looking for a name

So, work on the framework has progressed nicely for the past few months and it's time to think about the next steps.

While ng-objects is an â€¦ ok name, it was always meant to be a temporary placeholder for the real thing.

Any ideas or contributions for a real name would be nice.
