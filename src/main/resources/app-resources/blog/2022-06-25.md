## Looking for a name

So, work on the framework has progressed nicely for the past few months and it's time to think about the next steps.

```ng-objects``` was always meant to be a temporary "codename" while we're doing development. Now that we've started writing documentation, finding a final name is becoming important.
But as we know, naming things is one of the hardest things in programming so any ideas are very, very welcomed!

My first thoughts on criteria are

* fun and playful
* while still sounding professional
* memorable
* easy to search for (i.e. not too short and not drowned out by unrelated results)
* bonus points for good "mascotability" (i.e. it helps with the creation of a logo or mascot that's recognizable and relates to the name)
