# State of the project

So. For a couple of years, I've been working on a little "clone of WO" as a side project. Here's a 

## Template parser

The template parser in ng-objects a pure rip-off of the WOOgnl-parser in Project Wonder (with some slight changes and updates through the years). If there's one thing I'd like to 

## Template rendering

Template rendering works fine. If there's one thing I'd like to make better, it's error reporting during template rendering. The kilometer long stack traces that occur during template rendering are not really helpful, and do not give a lot of context for each stack trace element. This is something we can definitely improve

# General considerations

## Component actions

## Global NGApplication object

WO has a global application object accessed via a static method on NGApplication. ng-objects apes this up this approach, but using a global NGApplication object has problems, most importantly it always means you can only have _one_ application instance. This is a problem, especially during testing, where you might want to construct a few application objects / environments for testing.

So. The goal is to get rid of the global NGApplication object. The sole reason I haven't actually done it so far is because I haven't entirely decided how to replace it. NGApplication, like WOApplication, is functions a bit like an injector service with all it's create...() methods, handles a lot of global configuration etc. So it will go at some point, it's really just a question of when and how.

## NGApplication's initialization procedure

## Configuration (NGProperties)

## "Deployment Mode" ("Development mode" and others)

Like Project Wonder and ERXApplication, we currently have NGApplication.isDevelopmentMode(), but I'm not a big fan. There may be modes besides development and I'd like to try to think about them as a whole. What .isDevelopmentMode() really means is "I'm currently operating with a particular set of configuration loaded and I'll make decisions based on that".

## Routing

## Namespaces

Namespaces have not been implemented since we're still thinking about the proper way to do it and it's critical to "get right" early on.. WO currently has:

- a global namespace for dynamic elements/components/direct action classes (both classes and templates)
- "app" for application resources and
- "[frameworkName]" for frameworks.

## Plugins/Modules ("Frameworks")

On a related note, plugins are going to have to be a thing (plugin basically meaning what "framework" means in WO; a bunch of code and configuration). These _are_ implemented in a somewhat simplistic manner at the moment but like with namespaces, a "final design" has not been decided on, and again, they're a little critical to get right.

## Direct Actions

In ng-objects, the routing routing mechanism kind of replaces Direct Actions. There _is_ a rudimentary implementation of Direct actions (after all, DA functionality is simple and easy to implement), mostly for compatibility with older software, but I'm still considering if we really want include these in the future. Exposing class and method names feels a little iffy, so essentially, a route will always be a nicer way to create persistent reusable URLs. But, it could be provided as a plugin.

## Localization

We currently offer no support for localization. In fact I'm still thinking about if we actually _should_. I used WO's localization facilities at the very beginning almost two decades ago, but just stopped using it and implemented my own solutions where neccessary. But, as always, hearing voices on this matter from people that use WO's localization successfully today would be nice. Perhaps the improvements in Wonder are so vast that it's something that's worth taking a look at.

## Building software

You can build a runnable bundle

## Formatters

Soâ€¦ In WO world, WOString and WOTextField accept formatters and format patterns for numbers and dates. I'm still thinking about how best to implement this in ng-object. I'm a bigger fan of formatting in code, rather than using  but one way might to be to accept a formatter binding and while we could accept a java.text.Formatter, we might prefer a "formatter wrapper class" that could allow for more types of formatters (at last java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter which is kind of required these days). And I'm not sure about dateFormat and numberFormat...

## Development environment (WOLips?)

Since the templating language in ng-object is (still) the same as in WO, WOLips actually provides some niceties when working with it, like autocompleting in the template editor from keypaths in the associated java files.

* Integrate ng-objects support into WOLips
* Write an entirely new plugin
* Just clone WOLips and start removing what we currently don't use and clean up what we _do_ use.

Currently I'm leaning towards the third option. But then there's a fourth option of looking into support for IDEA or Visual Studio Code, both of which are probably good options to appeal to people more "hip" and "cool" than me.

## The webserver adaptor

The primary HTTP adaptor is currently written in Jetty. The original plan was to write our own adaptor, but it really turns out that the Jetty adaptor really works well - and it's nice to have someone else worry about the implementation details of the socket server.

## Unit testing

There are still veeery few unit tests present, primarily because the software's design was (and still is) very fluid. I'm mentioning this just to make a note that there will be excellent tests present in the software later :).

## Integration with WO deployment tools and environment

## NSKeyValueCoding

Our implementation of NSKeyValueCoding is still a little rudimentary, in some ways it's "better" than WO's NSKeyValueCoding, for example it works with internal classes like the `java.util.ImmutableCollections$ListN` generated by, for example `List.of()`. But one thing it does not support is operators (like appear in `"$people.@average.age"`). I'm still a little hesitant on whether to actually implement operators

## HTTP/2 and HTTP/3

HTTP/2 and /3 are still not supported, but that's something we definitely want to do. Before doing so, getting to know the protocols would be nice, so one can start thinking about creating a nice API to support them. And ensure that the HTTP APIs are designed in such a way that HTTP version doesn't get in the way of your work. You basically just want to be able to flip a switch, and be working with the current protocols transparently, while also getting access to work with the protocols' improvements.
